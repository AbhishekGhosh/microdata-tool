# HTML5 microdata testing tool #

This tool was written to aid in debugging and browsing HTML5 microdata.

To use this tool, simply include the script anywere after the inclusion
of the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) library (required version 1.4.x). When you
view the page, a list will appear in the bottom left listing all the microdata
objects detected on the page.

This tool is a work-in-progress and still doesn't adhere to the full specs (yet).
Plans to support the full microdata spec + data vocabulary validation are on
the drawing board. ;)
